# Setup

We'll need to prepare your computer to handle Ruby on Rails, which might be a hassle, so take a deep breath and cope with me :)

If you have Rails 7 installed, you can skip to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section

## Clone Repo

First clone this repo by running this command in your terminal:
~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/eduardosancho/rails-react-hello.git
# wait a couple seconds for it to download
# ...
# ...
# then move into the new directory
cd rails-react-hello
~~~
<hr>

## Prerequisites

The following technologies must be installed before hand in your local machine:

 - Ruby (ruby --version). Should be 3.0.1 or newer.
 - SQLite3 (sqlite3 --version)
 - Node.js (node --version)
 - Yarn (yarn --version)  

The commands in parenthesis `()` can be used to verify if they are installed and their corresponding versions.

Refer to [Section 3](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/getting_started.html#:~:text=3%20Creating%20a%20New%20Rails%20Project) from the official [Rails Guide](https://rubyonrails.org/) for more detailed instructions on how to install these technologies.
<hr>

### Install Rails
Once that's done, we can install Rails. For that, run these commands in your terminal:
~~~ bash
gem install rails
# wait a few seconds for it to download
# ...
# ...
# verify that it was installed by running
rails --version
~~~
<hr>

# Getting Started
The next steps setup the playing field for you to run the app in your local machine.

## System Dependencies

We're getting there... trust me ;)

Execute this command to automatically install all the dependencies needed to view and work on this project:

~~~ bash
bundle install

#and

npm install
~~~

The full list of dependencies can be found within the [Gemfile](Gemfile) and [package.json](package.json).

This also installs PostgreSQL, which you'll need for the next step.
<hr>

## Database Initialization
The following command will create the database and populate it with default data:
~~~ bash
rails db:setup
~~~ 
You can access the created databases manually via the command `rails db`.
<hr>

## Usage
If you got to this point, congratulations! You now have spent 2 hours in order to toy with my app. I appreciate your effort :P

## Start Server
The following command should start a server
~~~ bash
rails s

#or

rails server -p 3000
~~~
Which you can visit by going to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

If you want to see your changes reflected on the server, open a second terminal and run this command:
~~~ bash
./bin/webpack-dev-server
~~~
<hr>

## How To Contribute?

Always remember to commit your contributions on a different branch. You can create a new one by running `git checkout -b <branchname>`.

Visit [linters folder](.github/workflows/linters.yml) to learn how to setup linters.

Then check linters locally before pushing by running:
~~~ bash
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}" --fix
# ...
# ...
bundle exec rubocop -A
~~~

<hr>

# That's all folks!
